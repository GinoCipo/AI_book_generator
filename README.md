# AI_book_generator

## Purpose. 
This repository contains the basic scripts to create books from simple parameters using GenAI consuming from OpenAI's API.

## TO-DO:
- [ ] Organize output folder:
    Folders with numbers for each book, and re-directing output to these folders.

- [ ] Book generation without specific authors (left unchecked because we are lacking testing):
    - [x] Design a prompt that creates the books.
    - [x] Parametrize wether you are using authors or not.

- [ ] Continuity:
    Make it so that ChatGPT remembers context of old messages.
